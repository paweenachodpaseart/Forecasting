# Forecasting
Forecasting the Number of Passengers Boarding United Airlines Flights🛫

### 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on forecasting the number of passengers boarding United Airlines flights using monthly data from 2004 to 2010 obtained from Kaggle. The analysis is conducted using two main techniques:

1.Holt-Winters Method (Exponential Smoothing Adjusted for Trend and Seasonal Variation)
- Achieved the lowest Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.2507%.
  
2.Box-Jenkins (ARIMA Model)
- Verified assumptions of independence, normal distribution, and variance stationarity.

Both models were then used to forecast the number of passengers for the next 12 months.

### 🎯 Objectives
1. To develop an appropriate forecasting model for predicting the number of passengers boarding United Airlines flights.
2. To forecast the number of passengers boarding United Airlines flights.

### 🛠️ Tool: Minitab
